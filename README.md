# Quiz 8 - Design Research

## Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration
I was inspired by "Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse", especially its visual expression method of "multiverse characters corresponding to different art styles". Each Spider-Man in the film has a unique artistic style, such as black-and-white comics, Japanese anime, 3D cartoons, etc., which are highly recognizable.

I hope to draw on this "style layering" strategy in my project, allowing different characters or states to express different backgrounds and emotions by switching image styles.
